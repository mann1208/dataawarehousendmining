* Data warehousing is the process of constructing and using a data warehouse. 
* A data warehouse is constructed by integrating data from multiple heterogeneous sources that support analytical reporting, structured and/or ad hoc queries, and decision making.
* Data warehousing involves data cleaning, data integration, and data consolidations.
* Data warehouses serve as a central repository for storing and analyzing information to make better informed decisions.
* An organization's data warehouse receives data from a variety of sources, typically on a regular basis, including transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources.
* A data warehouse is a centralized storage system that allows for the storing, analyzing, and interpreting of data in order to facilitate better decision-making. 
* Transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources provide data into data warehouses on a regular basis.
* A data warehouse is a type of data management system that facilitates and supports business intelligence (BI) activities, specifically analysis. 
* Data warehouses are primarily designed to facilitate searches and analyses and usually contain large amounts of historical data.
* A data warehouse can be defined as a collection of organizational data and information extracted from operational sources and external data sources. 
* The data is periodically pulled from various internal applications like sales, marketing, and finance; customer-interface applications; as well as external partner systems. 
* This data is then made available for decision-makers to access and analyze. 
* A data warehouse is a large collection of business data used to help an organization make decisions.
* The concept of the data warehouse has existed since the 1980s, when it was developed to help transition data from merely powering operations to fueling decision support systems that reveal business intelligence. 
* The large amount of data in data warehouses comes from different places such as internal applications such as marketing, sales, and finance; customer-facing apps; and external partner systems, among others.
* On a technical level, a data warehouse periodically pulls data from those apps and systems; then, the data goes through formatting and import processes to match the data already in the warehouse. 
* The data warehouse stores this processed data so it’s ready for decision makers to access. 
* How frequently data pulls occur, or how data is formatted, etc., will vary depending on the needs of the organization.
* A data warehouse (DW) is a digital storage system that connects and harmonizes large amounts of data from many different sources. 
* Its purpose is to feed business intelligence (BI), reporting, and analytics, and support regulatory requirements – so companies can turn their data into insight and make smart, data-driven decisions.
* Data warehouses store current and historical data in one place and act as the single source of truth for an organization.
* Data flows into a data warehouse from operational systems (like ERP and CRM), databases, and external sources such as partner systems, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, weather apps, and social media – usually on a regular cadence.
* The emergence of cloud computing has caused a shift in the landscape. In recent years, data storage locations have moved away from traditional on-premise infrastructure to multiple locations, including on premise, private cloud, and public cloud.
* Modern data warehouses are designed to handle both structured and unstructured data, like videos, image files, and sensor data. 
* Some leverage integrated analytics and in-memory database technology (which holds the data set in computer memory rather than in disk storage) to provide real-time access to trusted data and drive confident decision-making.
* Without data warehousing, it’s very difficult to combine data from heterogeneous sources, ensure it’s in the right format for analytics, and get both a current and long-range view of data over time.
* A data warehouse maintains a copy of information from the source transaction systems. This architectural complexity provides the opportunity to:
* Integrate data from multiple sources into a single database and data model. 
* More congregation of data to single database so a single query engine can be used to present data in an ODS.
* Mitigate the problem of database isolation level lock contention in transaction processing systems caused by attempts to run large, long-running analysis queries in transaction processing databases.
* Maintain data history, even if the source transaction systems do not.
* Integrate data from multiple source systems, enabling a central view across the enterprise. This benefit is always valuable, but particularly so when the organization has grown by merger.
* Improve data quality, by providing consistent codes and descriptions, flagging or even fixing bad data.
* Present the organization's information consistently.
* Provide a single common data model for all data of interest regardless of the data's source.
* Restructure the data so that it makes sense to the business users.
* Restructure the data so that it delivers excellent query performance, even for complex analytic queries, without impacting the operational systems.
* Add value to operational business applications, notably customer relationship management (CRM) systems.
* Make decision–support queries easier to write.
* Organize and disambiguate repetitive data.
* A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence. Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.
* Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. 
* Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. 
* Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.
