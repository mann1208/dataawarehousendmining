* The data mining tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of data mining. 
* Our data mining tutorial is designed for learners and experts.
* Data mining is one of the most useful techniques that help entrepreneurs, researchers, and individuals to extract valuable information from huge sets of data.
* Data mining is also called Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD). 
* The knowledge discovery process includes Data cleaning, Data integration, Data selection, Data transformation, Data mining, Pattern evaluation, and Knowledge presentation.
* Our Data mining tutorial includes all topics of Data mining such as applications, Data mining vs Machine learning, Data mining tools, Social Media Data mining, Data mining techniques, Clustering in data mining, Challenges in Data mining, etc.
* A data warehouse is a central repository of information that can be analyzed to make more informed decisions. 
* Data flows into a data warehouse from transactional systems, relational databases, and other sources, typically on a regular cadence.
* Business analysts, data engineers, data scientists, and decision makers access the data through business intelligence (BI) tools, SQL clients, and other analytics applications.
* Data and analytics have become indispensable to businesses to stay competitive. Business users rely on reports, dashboards, and analytics tools to extract insights from their data, monitor business performance, and support decision making. 
* Data warehouses power these reports, dashboards, and analytics tools by storing data efficiently to minimize the input and output (I/O) of data and deliver query results quickly to hundreds and thousands of users concurrently.
* Data mining is the process of analyzing a large batch of information to discern trends and patterns.
* Data mining can be used by corporations for everything from learning about what customers are interested in or want to buy to fraud detection and spam filtering.
* Data mining programs break down patterns and connections in data based on what information users request or provide.
* Social media companies use data mining techniques to commodify their users in order to generate profit.
* This use of data mining has come under criticism lately as users are often unaware of the data mining happening with their personal information, especially when it is used to influence preferences.
* Data mining involves exploring and analyzing large blocks of information to glean meaningful patterns and trends. 
* It can be used in a variety of ways, such as database marketing, credit risk management, fraud detection, spam Email filtering, or even to discern the sentiment or opinion of users.
* The data mining process breaks down into five steps. 
* First, organizations collect data and load it into their data warehouses.
* Next, they store and manage the data, either on in-house servers or the cloud.
* Business analysts, management teams, and information technology professionals access the data and determine how they want to organize it.
* Then, application software sorts the data based on the user's results, and finally, the end-user presents the data in an easy-to-share format, such as a graph or table.
* Data mining programs analyze relationships and patterns in data based on what users request. 
* For example, a company can use data mining software to create classes of information.
* To illustrate, imagine a restaurant wants to use data mining to determine when it should offer certain specials. 
* It looks at the information it has collected and creates classes based on when customers visit and what they order.
* In other cases, data miners find clusters of information based on logical relationships or look at associations and sequential patterns to draw conclusions about trends in consumer behavior.
* Warehousing is an important aspect of data mining. Warehousing is when companies centralize their data into one database or program. 
* With a data warehouse, an organization may spin off segments of the data for specific users to analyze and use.
* However, in other cases, analysts may start with the data they want and create a data warehouse based on those specs.
* Association rules, also referred to as market basket analysis, searches for relationships between variables.
* This relationship in itself creates additional value within the data set as it strives to link pieces of data. 
* For example, association rules would search a company's sales history to see which products are most commonly purchased together; with this information, stores can plan, promote, and forecast accordingly.
* Classification uses predefined classes to assign to objects.
* These classes describe characteristics of items or represent what the data points have in common with each.
* This data mining technique allows the underlying data to be more neatly categorized and summarized across similar features or product lines.
* Clustering is similar to classification. 
* However, clustering identified similarities between objects, then groups those items based on what makes them different from other items.
* While classification may result in groups such as "shampoo", "conditioner", "soap", and "toothpaste", clustering may identify groups such as "hair care" and "dental health".
* Decision trees are used to classify or predict an outcome based on a set list of criteria or decisions. 
* A decision tree is used to ask for input of a series of cascading questions that sort the dataset based on responses given.
* * Sometimes depicted as a tree-like visual, a decision tree allows for specific direction and user input when drilling deeper into the data.
* K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is an algorithm that classifies data based on its proximity to other data. 
* The basis for KNN is rooted in the assumption that data points that are close to each are more similar to each other than other bits of data. 
* This non-parametric, supervised technique is used to predict features of a group based on individual data points.
* Neural networks process data through the use of nodes. 
* These nodes is comprised of inputs, weights, and an output.
* Data is mapped through supervised learning (similar to how the human brain is interconnected). 
* This model can be fit to give threshold values to determine a model's accuracy.
* Predictive analysis strives to leverage historical information to build graphical or mathematical models to forecast future outcomes.
* Overlapping with regression analysis, this data mining technique aims at supporting an unknown figure in the future based on current data on hand.
* In general terms, “Mining” is the process of extraction of some valuable material from the earth e.g. coal mining, diamond mining, etc. 
* In the context of computer science, “Data Mining” can be referred to as knowledge mining from data, knowledge extraction, data/pattern analysis, data archaeology, and data dredging.
* It is basically the process carried out for the extraction of useful information from a bulk of data or data warehouses.
* One can see that the term itself is a little confusing. In the case of coal or diamond mining, the result of the extraction process is coal or diamond. 
* But in the case of Data Mining, the result of the extraction process is not data!! Instead, data mining results are the patterns and knowledge that we gain at the end of the extraction process.
* In that sense, we can think of Data Mining as a step in the process of Knowledge Discovery or Knowledge Extraction.
